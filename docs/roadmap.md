# DIDSA-CAD Roadmap — Open Work

This tracks outstanding, not-yet-resolved work only. For project history and
everything already shipped/fixed, see `docs/status.md`. For the original
project spec, see `docs/project-brief.md`.

## Other open items

- **"Hidden lines" view mode.** Mentioned by the user as a wanted future
  addition. Not implemented. Would need its own render-mode entry
  (alongside Shaded / Shaded+Edges / Wireframe) that renders occluded
  edges distinctly (e.g. dashed) rather than hiding them entirely. (No
  longer tied to any occlusion bug - the C3 edge/face-highlight
  occlusion bug this was once floated as a workaround for turned out to
  have a real fix; see `docs/status.md`'s "C3 residual edge/face-highlight
  occlusion bug: resolved" entry.)
- **Pre-existing, unrelated test failures flagged but not fixed** across
  several status entries (e.g. `addCollinearConstraint`/
  `addEqualLengthConstraint`/`applyConstraintOption(collinear)` not
  clearing the selection set in one specific test scenario, and
  `dragTargetPointIdAt` offering the origin as a drag target in
  `sketch_controller_test.dart`) — flagged in Prompt B's status doc as
  newly *visible* (not newly introduced) once a missing import let that
  test file load for the first time in a sandbox. Still open as of the
  last time it was checked.
- **Draco-compressed glTF/GLB support (`KHR_draco_mesh_compression`) - not
  implemented.** A real ODM/OpenDroneMap `.glb` export uses it; the mesh
  viewer currently detects it up front and fails with a clear, specific
  error rather than crashing (see `docs/status.md`'s "Same ODM file, real
  root cause found: Draco mesh compression" entry) - it does not actually
  decode the compressed geometry. Real Draco decoding needs an
  entropy/range decoder plus edgebreaker-style connectivity
  reconstruction - a genuine binary-codec implementation, not a small
  addition - and there's no ready-made pure-Dart package to lean on; a
  native/FFI Draco library would be a materially bigger dependency change
  (platform-specific binaries). Whether to pursue this, versus relying on
  re-exporting without mesh compression (available in most pipelines that
  use it, including ODM's), is an open question for the user - not decided.
- **glTF node transforms: full scene-graph walk now implemented, but
  `matrix`-based nodes are still rejected rather than decomposed.** The
  original fix only inspected root scene nodes, which turned out to be
  wrong for a real Blender export (the transform-bearing ancestor is often
  several levels above the actual mesh node) - now fixed via a full
  recursive walk composing every ancestor's transform (see
  `docs/status.md`'s "glTF node transforms, round 2" entry). The remaining
  gap: a node anywhere in the hierarchy using a raw `matrix` instead of
  separate translation/rotation/scale fields is rejected with a clear
  error rather than decomposed (correctly handling non-uniform
  scale/reflection when decomposing an arbitrary matrix is real
  complexity, not attempted here). Not decided whether it's worth building
  without a real file that needs it.
- **Larger Blender-exported `.glb` still crashes** - reported multiple times
  now (after the round-1 node-transform fix, again after round 2's
  recursive-walk rewrite, and most recently after the mirroring
  investigation), each time with no new diagnostic information ("still
  crashes" with no visible in-app error). A plausible, concrete mechanism
  was found and mitigated - `buildMeshViewerMaterials` had no total budget
  on texture memory across a file's materials, only a per-texture cap (see
  `docs/status.md`'s "Texture-memory budget for the mesh viewer" entry) -
  but this was **not confirmed against the actual crashing file** (too
  large for the user to upload directly), so it's a real, previously-
  uncapped gap rather than a proven fix for this specific crash. If it
  still crashes after this, an actual crash log (e.g. `adb logcat` output
  captured around the crash) is the only way to make further progress
  without guessing again.
- **Mesh viewer Up-axis toggle only handles a Y/Z mismatch, not an
  arbitrary one.** Resolved for the real case that motivated it - a
  Blender export that skipped its "+Y Up" conversion, leaving the file's
  real "up" in Z instead of the glTF-spec-mandated Y (see `docs/status.md`'s
  "Root cause found: the file's own data isn't Y-up" entry) - via a new
  manual `MeshUpAxis` (`y`/`z`) View-menu toggle, since there's no reliable
  way to auto-detect this from the file alone. Not handled: a file with a
  totally different/arbitrary axis convention (e.g. X-up, or a non-90-degree
  misalignment) would need a more general fix than a simple Y/Z choice -
  not attempted, since no real file needing it has come up yet.
- **Mesh viewer decimation triangle-budget and default Up-axis settings are
  global, not per-device-profile.** `MeshViewerPreferences` (new this
  session) is a single flat set of values, not a saved list of profiles a
  user could switch between (e.g. "this phone" vs "that tablet") - fine for
  a single device, would need real design work to extend to multiple.
  Not requested, not attempted.
